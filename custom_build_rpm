Custome Build RPM

I had a task to install a rpm WALinuxAgent into a linux image which will be used to boot VM in Microsoft Azure.
It is not like just do a "apt-get install" on a Ubuntu server because the Linux OS version is pretty old - Redhat 6.1.
I cannot find the rpm for my Redhat 6.1, because Microsoft Azure required WALinuxAgent version should be later than 2.2.10.
After I checked the source code, I found there are only a few dependencies. These dependencies are compatible in my OS.
So I decided to build rpm from source code.

I have these requirements:
1. Default installation dir is /usr/local/lib/python2.7, my OS dir is /use/lib/python2.7
2. Build rpm on Ubuntu, install rpm to Redhat 6.1
3. Update some config in waagent.conf

WALinuxAgent use python library platform.linux_distribution() to get OS distribution to decide what dependencies library to
install. Because I don't have a compile setup in Redhat 6.1, I was building this rpm in Ubuntu, so I need to hack the setup.py
file to hard code the OS distribution. I also found the waagent.conf to modify.

After I update the setup.py and waagent.conf, I run "python setup.py bdist_rpm" to generate the rpm.
In build/bdist.linux-x86_64/rpm directory, I have these directories,

$ ls -ltr
total 24
drwxr-xr-x 2 jliu users 4096 Aug 16 22:33 SPECS
drwxr-xr-x 2 jliu users 4096 Aug 16 22:33 SOURCES
drwxr-xr-x 3 jliu users 4096 Aug 16 22:33 RPMS
drwxr-xr-x 2 jliu users 4096 Aug 16 22:33 BUILDROOT
drwxr-xr-x 2 jliu users 4096 Aug 16 22:33 BUILD
drwxr-xr-x 2 jliu users 4096 Aug 16 22:33 SRPMS

To change the python library install dir, I need to modify the SPECS/WALinuxAgent.spec file, add --prefix=/usr 
%install
python setup.py install --prefix=/usr --single-version-externally-managed -O1 --root=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT --record=INSTALLED_FILES

I use "rpmbuild -bb" to get a new rpm in RPMS dir.
Before run rpmbuild command, one more step to do is update the $HOME/.rpmmacros to set build dir to parent dir of SPECS.
%_topdir output_of_pwd my_build_dir

Then I run
$rpmbuild -bb SPECS/WALinuxAgent.spec

After build complete, check if rpm has right files by
$ cd RPMS/noarch
$ rpm2cpio ./WALinuxAgent-2.2.30-1.noarch.rpm | cpio -idmv

I can see this rpm installed to /usr/lib/python2.7 and the waagent.conf file is updated.
Now the rpm is ready to publish to build system to make my Linux image.
