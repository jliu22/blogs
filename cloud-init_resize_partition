Cloud-init resize Linux VM partition

I was working on a task to automatically grow root / partition of a VM after expand disk size.
Cloud-init tool was introduced to me. At first glance, this tool looked powerful. After I added this
tool rpm into my linux image and test on hyper-v manager, I found out there's some condition to make it work.

My use case is application installed on root partition of a linux image. When user boot a VM in Azure using this image,
user may want expand disk size. After VM reboot, we suppose the root partition will grow to take the new unallocated space
using this cloud-init tool.

While this is not true if root partition is not at the end of disk, I mean adjacent to the new unallocated space. 
For example, this is a block device table of a linux OS. 

# lsblk

NAME    MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda       8:0    0    22G  0 disk 
|-sda1    8:1    0 258.9M  0 part /bootmgr
|-sda2    8:2    0 133.4M  0 part /boot
|-sda3    8:3    0 133.4M  0 part 
|-sda4    8:4    0     1K  0 part 
|-sda5    8:5    0 517.7M  0 part /
|-sda6    8:6    0 517.7M  0 part 
|-sda7    8:7    0     3G  0 part [SWAP]
|-sda8    8:8    0    16G  0 part /var

# fdisk -l

/dev/sda6             134         199      530144+  83  Linux
/dev/sda7             200         591     3148739+  82  Linux swap / Solaris

When expand VM disk, the new space are added into bottom of the virtual disk. Cloud-init use growpart to grow partition.
Look at this example, the / partition is in the middle of block device, growpart cannot grow root partition to take new space.
It can only use the adjacent unallocated space.

So if you want try cloud-init to grow your linux root partition, please check your lsblk and fdisk first.
