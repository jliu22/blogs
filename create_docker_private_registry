Create Docker Private Registry

I was using Jenkins jobs for test automation. Each Jenkins job has bash script to build docker image and run different tests.
I thought use docker private registry so jenkins job can pull docker images from registry than build again to save some time.
The server run registry and Jenkins servers are all installed Ubuntu 16.04.

1. create certificate
# mkdir -p /certs
# openssl req \
  -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256 -keyout certs/domain.key \
  -x509 -days 365 -out certs/domain.crt

Then fill the info required, the Common Name will be used in registry name.

-----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:
Locality Name (eg, city) []:
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:myhost
Email Address []: 

In /certs there are two files: domain.key and domain.crt.

2. create docker registry
# sudo docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry \
  -v /certs:/certs \
  -e REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/certs/domain.crt \
  -e REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY=/certs/domain.key \
  registry:2

# docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
7e0f546dbb65        registry:2          "/entrypoint.sh /e..."   3 seconds ago       Up 1 second         0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp   registry

3. install certificate
# mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/myhost:5000
# cp /certs/domain.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/myhost:5000/ca.crt
# service docker reload

Now I can push image to docker registry.
# docker push myhost:5000/testimage

4. pull from registry on other machines
Login to another server, then
# mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/myhost:5000

copy the certificate from registry server
# scp root@myhost:/etc/docker/certs.d/myhost:5000/ca.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/myhost:5000/.
# service docker reload

Now I can pull image from docker registry.
# docker pull myhost:5000/testimage
